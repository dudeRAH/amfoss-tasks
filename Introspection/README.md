# Introspection

### Why must we choose you?
I have always wanted to code and had a curious mind to learn coding some day. I was not sure I could have a try at amFOSS, I thought I wouldnt be able to do well.
But then my mentor told me I dont require any previous experience to do this, and I feel happy to have tried it because I am loving what I am doing and would want to explore more.

### How were you before joining and how are you now
I was very insecure about my coding skills and I thought I would never be able to learn it. 
But now I feel I am getting more comfortable with it and also I have an excellent learning environment there to nurture my enthusiasm. 

### What are your comments and suggestions regarding the selection process
I would say that the selection procedure is a little bit challenging which is alright, but if possible could have included more intuitive questions(maybe one or two more questions) would be fun.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months? 
I would want to help my peers with some coding too, because i believe that we learn better when we teach someone.
It would also be helpful for those struggling with coding or those new to it.

### How would you contribute back to the club?
I would contribute back to the club by collaborating with people with higher knowledge or experience, learning from them, and as much as possible try to build applications which may help many people.

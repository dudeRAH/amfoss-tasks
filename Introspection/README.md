# Introspection

### Why must we choose you?
I have always wanted to code and had a curious mind to learn coding some day. I was not sure I could have a try at amFOSS, I thought I wouldnt be able to do well.
But then my mentor told me I dont require any previous experience to do this, and I feel happy to have tried it because I am loving what I am doing and would want to explore more.

### How were you before joining and how are you now
I was very insecure about my coding skills and I thought I would never be able to learn it. 
But now I feel I am getting more comfortable with it and also I have an excellent learning environment there to nurture my enthusiasm.

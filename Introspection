# Introspection

### Why must we choose you?
I love learning new things, I look forward to do coding as well as various other stuffs that come along the way. I was always amused by what people could do nowadays, and i would definitely love to learn and become one among them. I hope i can nail this oppurtunity.

### How were you before joining and how are you now
I am still yet to learn new things as it barely got started, but i can definitely say that i see this as a vast oppurtunity for me to excel in something i love doing. I hope after a few more sessions, i will be more faster and accurate in coding.

### What are your comments and suggestions regarding the selection process
I found the tasks pretty interesting but it is difficult to complete all of them in the short time, difficult it is- but not impossible, I still think i can complete them before the deadline. My suggestion is if it could be a little more simpler, freshers without much knowledge in coding could ace it.

### How would you contribute back to the club?
I would love to do my best in coding or programming, all that i am currently capable of doing. I am learning new stuff each day, so i can finally do something out of the box.

# Installing Ubuntu
## The steps that I followed to install Ubuntu on my laptop are mentioned below :

There are 2 basic ways to install Ubuntu, one being installation from a preinstalled Disk. But I didnt have the disk, so i tried the second method which is using a USB flash drive/CD.

#### Note: I installed using a USB flash drive because literally no one burns files to a CD for flashing(that is old-school XD).


### Step 1: 
Download the Ubuntu iso file from official ubuntu website. The latest version that was available at the time i was trying to install was v20.04.

### Step 2:
Have a USB flash drive in FAT32 format in a bootable format. It is easily possible by using LinuxLive USB creator. 
Using it is pretty intuitive, just have to copy the iso into the USB using the 'flash icon' and after the process completes just shut down your computer.

### Step 3:
While restarting the computer, enter BIOS and change the boot order to allow the Flash Drive to boot first. After that restart the computer and the rest is the same as installing any other application.

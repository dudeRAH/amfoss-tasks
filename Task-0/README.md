# Installing Ubuntu
## The steps that I followed to install Ubuntu on my laptop are mentioned below :

There are 2 basic ways to install Ubuntu, one being installation from a preinstalled Disk. But I didnt have the disk, so i tried the second methodwhich is using a USB flash drive/CD.

#### Note: I installed using a USB flash drive because literally no one burns files to a CD for flashing.

### Step 1: 
Download the Ubuntu iso file from official ubuntu website. The lates version that was available at the time i was trying to install was v20.04.
### Step 2:
Have a USB flash drive or CD
